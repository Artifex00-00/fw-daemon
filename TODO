fw-daemon:
	pc.socks() an getOptString() return overlapping information

	remove all stale references to SANDBOX: rules/policyForPathAndSandbox()


fw-prompt:
	scope returned by new rules is bad (always set to process)

	prompter should have a timestamp field

	Iteration through fw-prompt choices can't brute force by index #

	This function needs to be updated because it no longer works:
		func toggleHover() { mainWin.SetKeepAbove(len(decisionWaiters) > 0) }

	Each duplicate prompt needs to be expandable into individual items


gnome-shell:
	Start using new async DBus methods



new go-procsnitch vendor package changes should be pushed into main project
