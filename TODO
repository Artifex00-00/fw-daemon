fw-daemon:
	pc.socks() and getOptString() return overlapping information

	remove all stale references to SANDBOX: rules/policyForPathAndSandbox()


fw-prompt:
	apply once rules still do not work because they the DBus invocation requires the guid to be passed

	more nesting for similar prompts (by application, pid, target host, etc)




new go-procsnitch vendor package changes should be pushed into main project
