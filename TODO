fw-daemon:
	pc.socks() and getOptString() return overlapping information

	remove all stale references to SANDBOX: rules/policyForPathAndSandbox()

	TLSGuard needs a lot of stuff removed


fw-prompt:
	apply once rules still do not work because they the DBus invocation requires the guid to be passed

	more nesting for similar prompts (by application, pid, target host, etc)


gnome-shell:
	Start using new async DBus methods
